# cp-template

> Make anything into a template like cp on steroids

Many times, code gets repetitive or a new feature needs to be built which is almost identical to some existing code but needs to be modified
for a different use case in which a common abstraction doesn't make sense.

This is why I invented cp-template back in 2016. Simply take some existing code, invoke Duplicate (template),
specify the source text to template on and the target replacement, and ba-da-boom ba-da-bing!

I hope you enjoy using it as I have enjoyed making it!

## What is this repo?

This is a pnpm workspace (monorepo) that contains the core or cp-template as well as a vs code extension.
